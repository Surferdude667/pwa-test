## Gotchas

> Turns out that when you call `navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js)` the request for `service-worker.js` _isn't_ intercepted by any service worker's `fetch` event handler.

Since _that_ request is not handled by the service worker the service worker itself is always requested from the server. Which leads to at least one request to the server _every_ time, completely negating the offline capability ðŸ˜­.

However _that_ special request _does_ respect the http caching headers. So that "completely negating the offline capability" is not actually true ðŸ˜…. But rather, offline capability only works for as long as the service worker does not need to be re-fetched. Meaning at most until the cache time expires or the file is evicted by the browser.
